REST IN PEACE
A minute of silence for the Commands 101 ytvideo, 102 ytaudio, 103 ytplayaudio, 104 ytsubs, 105 ytdescription and 106 watch. They were always very buggy and thanks to youtube didn't work at all in the end, which was at the time where I just wanted to finish this project and not do anything too big anymore. These command would've been able to download youtube videos, download only their audios, play their audios, download the subtitles, download the description and play a video with 2FPS as asciiart in the assistant window. The first one was the only one that ever worked however.
blackjack

hacker
Command #130: hacker@@Starts a hacking screen. Or what most people think hacking looks like. You can use it in school to prank your teacher, at least that's what those "simulators" are usually used for. There's no other purpose for it, but it might break through the Pentagon's firewall and convert all the money of the US to bitcoins which get washed through a network of Zombie Computers and then find their way on your bank account.
txt@@txtroti@@txtngnl@@txtwilbur
Commands #200+: txtroti, txtngnl, txtwilbur@@Copy-paste commands that should've been moved into the database command, but I just can't be bothered anymore. Sorry.@@It still works however. They tell you the Rules of the Internet, the rules in No Game No Life (yes I was a weeabo once) and the Rules of Wilburs Soots Try not to laugh challanges (yes I once liked them and the older videos are still good).
